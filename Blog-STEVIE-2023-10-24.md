- Run

```
npx create-expo-app app-name
cd app-name
npm install
```

(you can use --template to get options for pre-made apps (small))

- Now the app is made. You can host a local server with `npx expo start`
- You can run it on either an emulator (like Android Studio) or you can download the expo go app from the Google Play store or the App store and run it your own phone (providing it's on the same network)
- Logging in or creating an account (https://expo.dev/signup) saves projects you make for quicker running of projects on devices
